**Real-Time Submarine Simulation** 🌊⚓

**Overview**
This project is a real-time submarine simulation built in Java, featuring dynamic submarine movement and a spiral search pattern to mimic realistic underwater navigation. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) provides interactive controls for position, speed, and direction.

The system leverages Java timers and graphics classes to update motion continuously, animate submarine and searcher paths, and calculate real-time distances between objects.

**Features**

🚢 Dynamic submarine movement with realistic pathing.
🔄 Spiral search pattern for the searcher.
🖥 GUI controls for position, speed, and direction adjustments.
⏱ Timer-driven animations for smooth, real-time updates.
📏 Live distance calculations between submarine and searcher.

**Technologies Used**
Language: Java
GUI Framework: Swing

**How It Works**
1. The submarine moves according to user-controlled speed and direction.
2. The searcher follows a spiral search algorithm.
3. A timer updates both entities in real time.
4. Distances are calculated dynamically and displayed in the GUI.
5. Animations provide a clear visualization of submarine and searcher interactions.
